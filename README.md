Hands-on Lab Exercise
Exploring Google Colab:
• Get familiar with the Google Colab environment and its
features.
Demonstrating Python Proficiency:
• Showcase your Python skills by creating and running a
simple example.
Practical Examples of Key Packages:
• Work with some of the packages introduced during the
lecture and run basic examples.

Hands-on Lab Exercise
1. Measure of Central Tendency:
1. Given the dataset [12, 15, 14, 10, 18, 20, 22, 17, 19, 13, 16, 15, 14, 21, 23],
calculate the following:
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode
2. Measure of Dispersion:
1. Using the same dataset, calculate the following:
1. Variance
2. Standard Deviation
3. Range
3. Data Visualization:
• Plot the given dataset using an appropriate chart (e.g., histogram, box plot, or
line chart) to visually represent the data distribution.
Exercises
Real-World Data Analysis:
• Read data from a CSV dataset (use a real-world benchmark dataset).
• Perform descriptive statistical analysis on the dataset, including
measures of central tendency and dispersion.
• Plot meaningful and significant visualizations to illustrate key
insights from the data.

Exercises
Homework Exercise: Central Limit Theorem and Sampling Methods
Objective:
Use the Central Limit Theorem to analyze sample means and apply basic sampling methods to a real-world dataset.
Dataset:
Use the "Iris" dataset, widely available in data science resources and Python libraries.
Tasks:
1. Data Loading and Overview:
1. Load the Iris dataset using Python's seaborn or sklearn library.
2. Display the first few rows to get familiar with the data.
2. Simple Random Sampling:
1. Randomly sample 30 observations from the dataset.
3. Sample Mean Distribution Analysis:
1. Repeat the random sampling 100 times, each time calculating the mean sepal length.
2. Plot the distribution of these 100 sample means using a histogram.
4. Do sampling like systematic sampling by taking 20percent of dataset with your novel function and
then plot original and sample datset




#DAY4
Hand-on Lab Exercises
Generate a Random Population:
• Create a random dataset representing a population of size 2000.
Extract Samples:
• From the generated population, randomly select two independent
samples for analysis.
Perform Statistical Tests:
• Conduct the following tests on the datasets:
• t-Test: Compare means between the two samples.
• ANOVA Test: Analyze variance across the population and the samples.
• z-Test: Evaluate differences when population parameters are known.
Visualize the Results:
• Create meaningful plots to illustrate the outcomes of each statistical
test, highlighting key findings and insights.

Exercises
Dataset: Use the Iris dataset from Day 3 or a sampled subset.
1. T-Test:
1. Compare the mean petal lengths of two species (e.g., Setosa vs. Versicolor).
2. Null Hypothesis: Means are equal.
3. Use an independent t-test.
2. Z-Test:
1. Test if the mean sepal length of one species equals a specific value (e.g., 5.0).
2. Null Hypothesis: Mean equals 5.0.
3. Perform only if population standard deviation is known or n>30n > 30n>30.
3. ANOVA:
1. Compare mean petal widths across all three species.
2. Null Hypothesis: All means are equal.
4. Correlation/Regression:
1. Explore the relationship between sepal length and petal length.
